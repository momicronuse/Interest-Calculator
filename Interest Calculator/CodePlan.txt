1 - Calculating tax rates
	1.1 - Calculating tax Bands 
		If income is > 12570 and < 37700, tax band = 20%
		If income is > 37700 and < 125140 tax band = 40%
		If income is > 125140 tax band = 45%

	1.2 - Calculating untaxed savings
		If income is < 12570, savings tax% = 0.
		If income is > 12570 && < 17570, untaxed savings = 17570 - income.
		If income is >= 17570 && tax band = 20% (basic rate), untaxed savings = £1000.
		If income is >= 17570 && tax band = 40% (higher rate), untaxed savings = £500.
		If income is >= 1750 && tax band = 45% (additional rate), untaxed savings = £0.
		Any interest earned over untaxed savings is taxed at the rate of tax band

2 - Calculate if its worth to swap to ISA or keep paying tax in savings
	2.1 -
		Calculate interest earned on savings account at the end of the month, then calculate how much tax is paid on the interest earned and the net earnings

	2.2 -
		Calculate the maximum amount you can have in a savings account at the input interest rate without being taxed on it, assume any leftovers go into the ISA
        Then calculate the minimum interest rate the ISA would need to have to match the net earnings from the savings account

3 - Display information
	3.1 - 
		Display interest earned from savings account, tax paid on those savings, and the net earnings
		Display the minimum interest rate for the ISA, and the maximum amount of savings to keep in the savings account if money were to be moved to ISA
